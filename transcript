off with talking about how income taxes work in Singapore uh we also be touching on uh the different types of tax relief available uh I'll briefly cover about cpf tax relief then I'll pass on to Lin sing to talk about SRS uh what a common clients question that he uh he and his team uh gets from clients when it comes to SRS as well as SRS investing options right so so today's session we'll try to make it as interactive as possible um even as I speak lining is looking at all the different um questions from slido right and you know he will just interject uh and ask me those questions that you guys are asking uh as I go through the presentation as and when is relevant so that we don't break up the flow right so if you can just uh read through the questions from your fellow attendees um upvot the questions that you like um that will be very helpful for lining and I when it comes to addressing these questions okay yeah so let's get straight into it how does income tax in Singapore work right so as all of us know income tax in Singapore is uh fairly low right relative to other development markets um but I don't think we really conscientiously look at um you know how how it actually works right so um very briefly uh going through how this work and again um this is not meant to be text advis and I'm not trying to cover very specific scenarios here but generically what is covered under income tax would be things like rental income uh any site hustle or business income that you be make including the T tuition income that you might be earning uh by helping out your relative or friends kids right your full-time employment income uh SRS withdrawals is also uh could be taxed as part of income tax as well right I I think lining will be covering more of that later on what what is not tax is is actually any cap form of capital gains tax in general right dividends that we are getting from listed Securities uh as well as interest from bonds or savings accounts or fixed deposits right so this is something that is fairly unique in the developed world right so that's generally what is included in our income tax right and and of course there's this very familiar table that some of you would have seen quite a few times especially at the end of the year when you think about how to go and optimize your tax expense right so you can see um obviously Singapore has a progressive tax income tax system right where you are tax a larger percentage um as you earn more right so you can see that you know someone who is earning at a much higher tax bracket uh will be paying a lot more tax relative to someone who is uh at a much lower tax bracket right so so this is really just to make sure that um the reach pay pay more and contribute more to uh nation building right um and and I guess this uh you know this progressive income tax scheme actually uh makes some of this uh would bear a very big part of the consideration when it comes to how you look at cpf uh contribution cpf voluntary cpf topups as well as SRS contribution okay so uh one very simple way to think about how you want to plan your income tax would be really to just look at what you have paid last year as a basis right so I want to quickly run through what are the income tax uh you know what you can see from an income tax statement and also what you should be thinking about when it comes to planning for your uh reducing your income tax for for the coming year right so the first thing to uh think look at is obviously your your income right so you know uh the income tax statement uh when it comes to income breakdown after you fill up your uh tax fallings right you would uh they will show it as employment dividend and Rental income in general right uh so that is based on what you have declared right um one thing obviously to take note of is any changes in your for most of us here will be any changes inless uh do we have more bonus this year are we expecting uh any share options for example right so these are some things that would affect your employment income and consequently affect how much income tax you'll be paying later on okay uh and then the other thing will be the deductions right the tax relief that we will be enjoying uh enjoying if we were to um you know have changes in our personal circumstances or you know if we were to use things like uh cpf topups or SRS topups right so so this also would have an impact on your uh tax relief as well right so in particular for donations um it will form part of the the deductions and you know for every th000 that you contribute to um the in an Institute of public character you will get up to 2.5 times of uh tax relief right and then there's also uh things like SRS topups uh you know cpf topups uh some of the um tax relief that you get uh if you were to fulfill certain criteria right so typically these are uh putting aside cpf topups these are all automatically reflected on your income tax we don't have to do anything to it but again you know if you're a uh you know like lining if you're a new father or you know you a new working mother right some of this tax relief will be new to your income statement right and you have to factor that this in when you come comes to your tax relief planning uh yeah so what are the question that you need to ask yourself is what are the news tax relief tax savings that you might be getting from government or maybe even some of the discretionary schemes that you want to Pi up if especially after listening to this webinar um and the last thing is um what's your final chargeable income right so your final chargeable income is know what you would be uh paying for when you take your income minus your deductions uh and you'll get your chargeable income right so I think it's pretty straightforward it's really what uh you know looking at what's your chargeable income and sort of comparing that against that income tax table that I was sharing in the previous slide right so um this 7% here that you're looking at is is basically what you are going to get in terms of tax savings right so I think it's pretty straightforward as well right so you have to consider like what's the percentage of tax saving that you can get for any discretionary tax relief skill that you're taking up on right so yeah you know obviously if you earn more money then the kind of tax savings that you get from a percentage perspective is going to be higher right so you'll be more inclined to go and pick up some of these schemes okay so um that's about it I just want to highlight that there is a cap when it comes to income tax relief that you can get right so I think back in uh 20 before 2015 there there isn't such uh personal income tax relief cap but now there there is the income tax relief cap and that's uh kept at $80,000 right so you have to be very careful that you know you don't especially if you're looking at some of these schemes purely from a tax relief angle uh you should not be uh you should be very careful and not over top up or over contribute to your cpf and SRS accounts right so I think in particular I want to highlight that um for many of our working great working moms out there you know you are getting a lot of uh taxt relief from from that and then I do have colleagues who you know exceeded um this income tax relief cap purely from being a working M right so so be aware of that and uh and of of course if you are eligible for newly eligible for any of this uh please take note of that uh before you consider you know the discretionary uh income tax topup such as cpf topups and SRS stups and that's about it um D any questions that you see in relation to income tax um not specific to cpf and SRS no I think mostly most of the questions are um primar on cpf and SRS a lot of it on SRS okay yeah fantastic then let me maybe just run through the specific part on cpf first so yeah so how does cpf for Tex relief work right I I think um you know when I go to when I go to the ccs and I do this kind of sharing with other corporates as well what I realized is that it's a lot easier to remember how this policy work when we try to put oursel in the shoe of of a policy maker and understand the princip serer behind a lot of these uh schemes right and and really why the government is losing out income tax re uh tax revenue from us uh By Us encouraging us to do this topup is really to help us plan better for our own retirement or our family members retirement so you know you can see that a lot of these topups are centered around Med safe and special account as well as retirement account topups and there's a cap to it which is often at the full retirement sum and the basic healthare right uh the reason behind is very simple right like a lot of these topups are not meant to help rich people get even richer right so if you have if you are able to hit the full retirement sum or the basic healthare sum naturally you wouldn't be eligible for any further tax relief or you may not even be able to top up in the first place right and I do a there there's a screenshot here on how the cpf account Works look like and you can see that it's actually very very um user friendly by they even tell you how much uh remaining tax relief you have if you choose to do these topups on a very consistent basis like on a monthly basis so can I just quickly jump in here um so so I I know before shingi gets into the details of all the cpf uh tops you know I I think one thing to remember is um there's a lot of detail and then I think often the refrain from people is that the cpf system is is quite complex uh I I would say that um the quote unquote complexities is actually uh because it is a very robust system that that tries to cater uh for as many uh cpf members as much as possible so uh before we get into the into the into the weeds or into the the detail I hope you you you uh be encouraged that the details are there uh because the cpf system tries to cater for as much uh various life possibilities uh various various uh individuals with different life circumstances uh and try to uh yeah try to be as robust as a system for for singaporeans and and cpf members at large so uh yeah so I must confess that uh only when I joined endows that I I really understood the CPS system and actually how how wonderful it is um without siging sounding like a cpf Advocate you know we not PID to see this but it is a very robust system that enables us to plan better for retirement so you know I I hope you you guys are excited about uh hearing from on the details yeah so just I wanted to just chime in on that yeah yep great so yeah let me go straight into it right so um you know specifically around cpf topups for tax to get tax relief right we can that there's two ways to go about it right so one part of it is uh helping ourselves to better plan for retirement and and for our own healthare cost and then the other part of thing is to help our loved ones for their retirement right so um let's cover the cpf top for ourselves El first right we can pop up either into our medve account or our special account right and there's uh a top up limit for tax relief of $8,000 right so this is uh you can definitely top up more than that right but you wouldn't be eligible for tax relief if to do that right and the way some people think about it is that um you know they want to save the top up limits for next year's tax relief and therefore they wouldn't top up anything beyond $8,000 right um I I mean of course not all of us would want to would have the money to top up $8,000 into our cpf account right you are free to do a $1 top up a $100 top up a $500 topup I think it's uh it's really up to you and and you can also consider the frequency of it right so some people uh choose to top up at the start of the year so that they get to earn more interest along the way um but for other people like for myself right I I very much prefer to do it at the end of the year you know just in case that I have any uh contingencies when it comes to my my cash flow right it's really dependent on you and the best thing about this is that there's no transaction fees involved right okay and as I was sharing um these topup limits are kept at uh you know the the basic Healthcare sum as well as the full retirement sum right and the prevailing amount is as shown on the screen uh 68,500 and $198,800 respectively for I Ma and sa okay uh I want to share a little bit more about the cpfs topup though the cpfs a topup um there's some terms and condition uh that's applied to it and the way it works is actually a bit different from you know how you usually get cpf SAA monies into your special account which is through your employment contribution right you have to be aware that uh you know cpfs top ups and the interest that is at attributed to these topups uh cannot be invested and therefore cannot be shielded right so so this is something that you have to be uh you have to consider right and and also because of that there's some form of some level of uh uh it's it's dependent on how there there's some policy leas when it comes to cpf life uh such as changes in withdrawal age and so forth right um also cpf topups and uh it interest cannot be withdrawn as cash even though you know you could be able to withdraw the other amounts uh from your employment contribution as cash right so uh you know some people would say that you know if you're younger then you know you you may not want to uh contribute into cpfs so early because there's some uh you know there might be some changes to cpf life um but yeah it's really dependent on how you look at things y so let's move on to cpf cach essay topups right so for cpf cash topups for your loved ones um you can top up to your parents grandparents and in-laws and there's no criteria for that at all right you might uh you might want to go and uh the only criteria is that there's a limit to the full retirement sum roughly the full retirement sum of your parents and your grandparents right for spouse and siblings it's a bit different right they have to be low income or they have to be uh not able to work right so there are some specific criterias around that I will go into the details of it um but unlike cpf top up for yourself there's no topup for your medic sa right so that's something that you have to uh take into account okay so you know I I really have to highlight this uh cpf matching retirement sum scheme right so this is uh basically where you get uh free money from the government right to some extent right so it is a scheme that was announced in 2020 uh he has is slated to run for 5 years um there are some news that it might be extended um and and what you get from this is really uh a matching dollar for dollar matching for any topups you would to put into your uh parents or grandparents cpf account um if they were to meet certain criterias right up to $600 right you also get tax relief uh from from the cash toop ups and of course you get the very attractive uh cpf interest along the way which is uh you know as high as 6.04% for those of those people who uh you know who have parents or grandparents who are not who have a very small cpf balance U um basically right so there has already been 68 million paid out to 117,000 cpf members um so you really want to jump into jump onto the ship if you have not done so right um so this is really for for singaporeans older singaporeans who are age between 55 to 70 um they they also need to have a retirement account balance of less than the full basic retirement sum they are also not uh if they are not earning if they're earning Beyond a certain limit which is $4,000 monthly now then they would also not be eligible but again uh I would encourage you to go into the details on cpf website and and learn a bit more okay um there is a very high uh you know there's a tax scenario that I like to pain uh just to you know for us to go and see how it actually applies to us individually right so in this example we we mentioned about John John has uh started work with bco pay of around $100,000 and that's net of you know all the cpf contribution right and he's able to save $35,000 right um obviously he wants to go and help his aging parents he want to help himself plan better for retirement and is considering to uh you know get as much tax relief as possible from cpf right cpf to specifically right so he uh where he is in terms of his tax bracket putting aside all the other you know tax relief that he potentially can can get so we are assuming that his chargeable income now is $100,000 right and at $100,000 he's very squarely uh at the 11.5% tax bracket with 20% of his uh income being at the 11.5% tax bracket right so if you to top up that $16,000 into his uh cpf account and his parent cpf account then he will be getting 11 11.5% tax relief on it right and you can imagine that would be around 1, uh700 uh $1,700 right so so this is how it works and I I guess the action item for him to consider is to you know he can top out $8,000 into his cpf uh sa or Ma account and then he can top up $4,000 each into his parents cpf retirement account and that's why is he splitting it out not because know maybe one parent he's forced to be uh fair to both his parents maybe he's caring about that but it's really to just make sure that you know they he gets uh that $600 matching retirement sum scheme from for both parents right so he's going to enjoys $16,000 wor of tax relief his parents going to enjoy the matching gr scheme and then he's they B off going to enjoy uh really high interest rates from cpf right so this is a quick summary of how uh he's going to benefit from this obviously he's going to get that 11.5% tax relief he's also getting some uh grants from cpf um interest as well and then you know you can sum up all the different uh benefits that is getting from this and this is actually pretty significant right if you to sum up um the interest and tax relief and the grants sums up to around um close to 3,000 almost $4,000 yes that's about it um Ling is there any question specific around cpf on slido there is one question uh that I think is quite interesting to to U address at this juncture before we head into SRS I think the question is what are the differences between topping up cpf and SRS and so which one is more beneficial um you want to you want to do a quick one on that before we into the SRS system um yeah there are really a lot of different considerations behind that um I think some of the points that we actually eventually get to this point right so some of the consider consideration is around your age um you know what do you intend to do uh do you have a more aggressive uh point of view where you want to grow grow your money's retirements money more aggressively or do you rather keep it on a So-Cal risk-free uh stable interest rate right and then um yeah so those are the two main considerations uh I I will not spoil the detail of that slide and I'll share probably share a bit more later on yeah great great great I think I'll just I'll just use this as a saue to the session just great quickly uh any topups to SRS and presumably the the the um the individual who asked a question um is somewhat familiar with SRS system um when you do when you do transfer money to your your SRS right um if you don't do anything with it uh it doesn't really earn much interest rates I think maybe right now I need 05% if memory SS me right whereas into the cpf be the SA or the ma you're looking at at least 4% so that's that's the immediate difference but um let's let's get into the SRS system proper right um so what is SRS SRS is basically the supplementary retirement scheme the very first misconception to people is for most people is that it is a scheme that is administered by cpf or part of the cpf system right very often um my client advisory team often hear people being confused uh between cpf saay and SRS right cpfs is cpf savings account which is part of the cpf system uh cpf SRS is a supplementary retirement scheme uh which is administered by the IRAs um Beyond being administered by a different Ministry um SRS is a voluntary scheme as compared to the cpf system another difference is that the while CPS is primarily for singaporeans and PRS SRS is Prim is open to foreigners as well right as you can see on the slide right single parans and PRS are able to contribute up to $15,300 voluntarily right uh into the SRS system uh and thereby enjoy uh some form of tax relief whereas the for foreigners are able to to um top up up to $ 35,700 right so those are some Salient differ between cpf and SRS now um the SRS operationally to open an SRS account is super simple um all you have to do you know I would say the majority of us singaporeans or even PRS we would have a local bank account DBS ocbc or UOB all you have to do is just go to the app uh find uh where to find your where to open the SRS account and you're able to open it pretty much inst instantaneously right and thereafter you get a SRS account number and you're able to link it to uh different we plat form such as endows and you are able to uh invest uh uh your C SRS money right the last thing I would say on this slide is that SRS is a tax deferment scheme it's not a tax avoidance scheme again that's that's a misconception uh and and I'll explain how that works um in in a bit right right so how does the supplementary retirement scheme actually work upon opening up your SRS account where when you make your first deposit let's say a dollar you will lock in the statutory retirement age by which you can begin to withdraw your SRS monies right currently is at age 63 years um and periodically um the statutory retirement age could increase for example when I opened my SRS account I believe about two or three years ago uh the statutory retirement age then was age 62 and because I deposited my first dollar then or contributed my first dollar to the SRS on then it locked in my uh retirement age at age 62 so even though the retirement age has increased for new joiners to the SRS system because I locked it in earlier I'm able or eligible to withdraw my money earlier so what does it mean to you what does it mean to to for for those of you who have yet to open your SRS account uh very simply after this you know this this uh this lunchtime talk go and figure out how to open the account to want the three local banks uh and and just deposit a dollar just to lock in a retirement age um you don't have to deposit more money than just a dollar uh until you figure out how best to use the SRS system uh for yourself right that's the first thing you should do now at the statutory retirement age you are able to then begin to withdraw uh monies uh from your SRS right and at the point of your first withdrawal uh which can be between the age of 63 or the statutary retirement age to age 70 which is the final age by which you can do a withdrawal um by which you need to do a withdrawal right you have 10 years to withdraw all your money right so just quickly answering some of the questions uh in the slide though um so there's a question is once we start re my SRS account the money in will have to be taken out within a time 10e time frame that's that's correct um so typically right now the first 20, 50% of what you would draw um at the age of re at the stat3 retirement age uh it's taxfree right but as we as we know right now uh any form of in um taxable income as long as is below $20,000 right it is also taxfree so The Sweet Spot uh is withdrawing about $40,000 as with existing policies um withdrawing $40,000 a year uh technically you are withdrawing it taxfree from your SRS account uh one thing to note is the taxable amount does not distinguish capital gains income and contribution and then finally just to reiterate right SRS withdrawals can be spread across a maximum of 10 years so technically if you have $400,000 in your account you withraw $40,000 across 10 years U technically you have withdrawn the $400,000 uh tax fee hopefully that that gives you an Insight of how the SRS uh system works right um next slide right so with the SRS system um actually withdrawing from SRS prior to the statutary retirement age is possible uh but with as with you know all things uh if there's some form of flexibility it comes with a caveat right and that comes with a penalty of 5% uh and in addition to that 100% of the redraw amount uh will uh be taxable so just looking on the on the on the right hand side of the slide right um some scenarios where early withdrawal with a penalty will happen 5% withdrawal rate withdrawal penalty 100% will be tax uh but further contribution to SRS are still allowed uh but now withdrawal with no penalty is you know as mentioned 50% withdrawals tax exemp upon retirement age a foreigners can withdraw in the lamam penalty free after 10 years on the date of their first contribution which is slightly different from singapor nprs just uh FYI um one thing to note and I think this is also another question upon your first withdrawal no further contributions are actually allowed right so there I think there's another question on whether you can simultaneously withdraw and then contribute uh upon retirement age that's not possible right now withdrawal is also penalty free in very extenuating circumstances like terminal owners medical grounds uh and death and so on and so forth now I would like to say that you know with with all these SRS policies as well as the cpf right policy changes from time to time uh we would encourage all the listeners or viewers to just I odically just visit the uh you know CPA website or the SRS website to to or sorry the ires website to get updates on any form of policy changes especially if um you need to do something beyond the norm such as withdrawing before the retirement age and so on and so forth that will give you further insight to perhaps any updates or any uh policy updates right um so next next slide please yeah maybe yeah there are some questions um around the withdrawal so um I think I probably can take this one first um so you know a non was asking you know we can withdraw $40,000 tax fee is it possible to withdraw it in the form of shares or or funds and and not have to liquidate your Investments so this is possible so that you know if you were to invest through sgx uh you can re right in to your um Asian bank and then basically have them facilitate a process where um SRS Investments are sort of like transferred into your CDP account invest ments uh you know I always receive this question on a yearly basis when it comes to uh you know is it possible that endows facilitate something like this currently we are not able to uh we are looking into building it um and and of course uh please please uh you know let us know if you're really interested in uh trans having this feature prioritized okay and then there's also another question around like you know once we start drawing from SRS the money inside has to be taken out within a 10 year time frame what's the strategy involved I think Len you covered it briefly right so as much as possible Right try to spread it out um as evenly as as you can right so that you can enjoy uh how the income tax system work which is a progressive income tax rate right and if it's to spread it out then you will be effectively paying as little income tax as possible yeah I think that's about it when it comes to question please carry on asking but yeah handing it back to you L sing sure so next slide please so just to uh again highlight um the text release scenario for John right so John you know his he attended one of our webinars and he's super super prudent about how to maximize and optimize his text release for the year so in addition to topping up his cpf uh for himself as well as his loved ones uh he also decided to top up his SRS right maybe he's got ocbc account for example right um and he oppos it and he tops up up to the Limit as a single Oran uh $15,300 so um just looking on the on on the side on the right hand side of the slide right his current tax savings so John's taxable income uh is has because of his cpf tops up right $16,000 it is reduces from $100,000 to $84,000 then in addition to that he further tops up $15,300 so his taxable income is further reduced to $68,700 therefore he will be taxed at the 7% tax bracket so what this means for John is that in totality he enjoys about $31,200 worth of tax relief right and the total tax savings so instead of paying 2,500 uh he pids $2,559 in tax instead of $5,650 right um and the total tax savings for him uh is at $3,000 or $3,000 uh in in in in the taxable uh in the year that he's been taxed right so this is quite significant um cash savings right I mean um it's a lot of money uh for for someone just starting out I mean for for anyone right so it is it pays to really look at your finances and to figure out what works best for you I will go on in the Lim to say that there isn't the need to fully top up the $15,300 for SRS right it's the limit uh you can top up $10,000 $5,000 depending on your life circumstances right um similarly for C PF as well there is no need to top up the full eight uh $16,000 right that's the limit right we would suggest right uh spend some time you know it's it's almost the year and you know it's time to take stock of the Year have a look at your spending have a look at how much you can save and then figure out what works best for you uh and if you're married and family what works what works best for you and your uh family I guarantee you uh the time spend just thinking uh and spending time just optimizing your uh how best to uh get Tech savings will go a long way uh into um yeah having a great uh a great end of the year as well as a great start to the year I I think something you know I'm talking about the start of the year I me just being a bit tangential um Shi didn't mention this but one little tip you want to share is if you're want to top up your cbfs is top up at the beginning of the year right because what that means is that you get to enjoy the full year of of of Interest I know for for you know some some uh members of the public you know they like to top up on the very first day of the year I mean after 12 midnight they just do a contribution to the essay um and it's something that the very first thing they do after the uh the New Year Rings uh because they want to enjoy the full year of 4% interest so that's something a little tip for those of you who are considering topping up uh your your cpf uh system but as mentioned earlier for SRS if you top up um there is there doesn't it doesn't enjoy the 4% interest rate right it's probably at 05 so quite minuscule uh and especially at a period of high inflation right now where we are looking at close to I don't know hitline 3.54 thereabouts um it is um not investing your SRS or not thinking about how to utilize it for uh retirement purposes uh in some sense I think you're doing yourself a disservice um I I think I think for the next slide I think uh yeah I think that that we have a couple of common questions uh I think yeah this one specifically you know we are yeah we understand that a lot of clients have uh you know asked this question in some form or other right and what they're asking is that you know does selling my SRS investment equate to withdrawing from my SRS account and therefore I'll be liable for the penalties I'll be liable for the 100% income tax is that no no so what happens is when you invest to your SRS monies are withdrawn from your SRS account into the respective investment similarly upon Redemption right the monies will go back to your SRS account right it's not paid to your bank account uh per se right so you don't not paid to your cash bank account cash bank account that's correct not your paid to your cash bank account but it's gone to your SRS account right so I I I think in short um it does not equate to withdrawing from your SRS account right so this is a very common question that we get so hopefully that clarifies for many of our viewers uh uh this common question um I I think on the same uh V I think there a couple of question um on actually investing s we could just quickly look at the slido uh maybe we we touch on the next comment question sure yes we can do the next comment question yeah so so Shi maybe I ask you this question right since you are master of all C all things CPM and SRS and endows uh what do you think are suitable investment options for SRS considering it pays very little interest these days uh what maybe you could share with the viewers um your thought process uh about how to invest uh maybe we can take a look at what people are doing first and then we think about what are the options available then we we look at um look at all the choices and holistically come to a conclusion right so uh you know very quickly um you know um when it comes to SRS Investments it's very similar to cpfi it's a I would say it's like a close ecosystem where you don't have access to the same type of products that you have as uh cash right so you can invest in crypto you can't invest in uh overseas listed Securities and what you have is a much smaller pool relative to what you have in cash right so what you can see is that from this chart from M of Finance more than 20% of SRS money are cash are losing out to inflation right so that's definitely not what you want to consider which is to just get a tax relief and not do more with your SRS monies right so the other thing is that you all of us have to be you know very cognizant of is that SRS funds are effectively longterm has a very longterm Horizon right especially for those of us who are in our 30s early 40s and you know we still got a good 20 plus years before we can withdraw SRS Mones right so with that kind of long-term Horizon we should be taking up more risk with it and get higher returns for our retirement right so looking at the type of uh different or common SRS investment options out there uh you know I just basically sort of like list them according to the uh bucket them according to their profile uh the different type of products out out there right you can uh something that's very very popular nowadays is TS and fixed deposits right U obviously because interest rates are at record high level and have sustained at a level for about a year and a half at least right and you can see that you know a three plus per 4% interest rates are very attractive right of course um it's uh these products Al are also uh distributed at very low cost right but of course um the bad side of it is that you know there's more work to be done because on every six months you have to go and you know go into the interface go and uh beat for the TBS read articles on what's the best beat uh what's the best beat that you can put up and then you know maybe even joining on the online argument whether you should put a very low uh rate or put a more Reon aable rate right and of course ultimately um these kind of risk free rates are going to lose out to inflation right um some people would say that you know investing in uh listed Securities and ETFs as those especially those listed in sgx would be better off right but um because you only pay a oneof transaction cost right you don't have to be paying a recurring fee right but but ultimately you know you will be limited to sgx offerings which typically are not globally Diversified right you also you also have to handle the the hassle with s sgx related offerings right and that would be know dealing with dividends dealing with a rights issue doing with dividends reinvestment plans uh you know having to handle uh you know Investments that are not very cleanly in in uh denominations as per what unit trust can do right which is you know you can invest a full $15,300 but you will not be able to invest $15,300 clearly when you buy a single stock or when you buy uh NF right because there was be due to lot size limitations you will not be be able to cleanly invest all that full amount right and of course some people would like to invest in annuity products and insurance product um I see that there are some question on sidos asking me you know if you know annuities and uh especially annuities would be a better product because you effectively extend uh the tax The Beneficial tax rate beyond that 10 years right it's great that way I want to clarify that you will still be taxed on your annuity income even though it's an annuity product right um the thing is that it's only at you're only being taxed at 50% of the withdrawal amount just that uh not the full 100% uh you know tax exemption right and the issue with annuity product is that you know often there as all of us are aware similar to other insurance related product there's a high cost there's no flexibility there will be a high penalty if you were to uh cancel or or break that um product right so so those are some of the considerations right um about endows uh investing in unit Trust on endows um it's really really simple right you you get automated investing right I heard of clients who have put in that full $5,300 uh let's say at the start of the year right in a cash Mark product and then they choose to dollar cost average from uh basically set up a recurring transfer from the cashk account into their you know slightly riskier or riskier uh SRS investment so that you know they they gradually get into the market right so it's really it can be really automated uh you can set up monthly recurring Investments and and this will be at a denomination if you uh that you prefer right you can set it up at $888 and we'll be able to execute for you uh if if you have a thing for you know like numbers that are signify certain meanings in Chinese right so so you also get access to very low cost globally Diversified products right um you know that could be in the form of Our advice portfolios it could also be in the form of the single funds that are available on funmart right and of course these are very RIS aligned right so you can you know if you're in your later part of your 40s or 50s and you want to really just uh get a pretty much a risk free return then you can look at some of the cash Mark uh products out there which are effectively investing in fixed deposits uh and treasury bills right um of course some people would say that you know endow is charging a recurring fee but you know if you were to factor all of the cost which we show very transparently is actually very very competitive relative to you know even some of the ETF products out there on sgx y so there's the question on common s uh SRS investing options and there is also a question around how we should be thinking about um you know paring between cpf topups as well as cash SRS topups right and I think maybe taking a step back even con thinking about you know whether we should uh commit our monies and having it locked up for retirement is really a matter of like planning around cash flows right um you know for those of us who are a bit younger uh we are we we might have a lot of long-term big commitments for our finances uh in the next one to two years right right it could be our wedding expenses it could be our uh you know BTO down payments hdb down payments and so on right so we have to uh plan those out before we commit to uh you know cpf and SRS contribution because you know we don't want to be Penny wise pound foolish when it comes to uh chasing for this tax relief right so that is uh really one of the first consideration right the ability to commit to a long-term plan right the the other thing is really you know have you hit your your personal income tax relief cap right um again uh I would like to highlight that especially for working months you are very likely to hit that 80,000 uh tax relief cap right so please refer to last year's uh noce of assessment please put out you know what are the new tax relief uh that you might be uh getting um because of changing life circumstances and then from there make a informed choice where how much SRS and cpf topups that you can get right so that's also another consideration and of course um your age and your risk consideration matters a lot right as with investing right because um as I was pointing out as lining was highlighting uh you know when it comes to SRS you almost have to invest it right and and investing it means that you have to take up higher race right so do take that into consideration and of course if you're younger I would say and and also if you are familiar with investing and can take volatility then SRS is a more natural choice because you can uh over 20 30 40 year period you're more likely to uh do better than 4% right if you're invested in the in the global markets right um and and of course that's also tight with whether you're happy with that 4% return right ultimately uh you know for some of you who are really like U people who are trying to max out the cpf system you know if you are already at your C BRS or F FRS limits then then obviously you can't top up anymore yeah so those are the considerations that you have to take into account um yes I think that's the end of today's presentation uh a couple of Q&A yeah let's take a couple of Q&A and and of course those of you who are very shy and have not asked any questions uh please drop your questions uh on slid now and we'll be very happy to Decor it yeah so as we look through the slider question I think also want to draw attention to uh to to the QR code right for those of you who are uh not yet endows clients we do have a special promo uh whereby if you sign up you will get $50 off your endow fee including SRS Investments so as we go through the slido questions I would hope uh you can scan it share it with your friends and family uh and just take take advantage of this great great um great promotion uh maybe let's quickly run through from top to bottom currently has 16 questions I think we have addressed quite a fair bit um I think the second question was the second most uped question was um what options are there on endow which allows me to use my cpfs I'll take that so currently there are no options um and I think there are two two reasons why first and foremost sa already pays you 4% um guaranteed uh sort of interest um and right now the sa products available uh by cpf are quite limited uh so at End hours we always try to prioritize the needs of our client um and while there are products available for sa and we can structure something uh but at current juncture with a 4% uh Guaranteed Rate I think that's quite a high minimum barrier to meet so uh hence we have um not come up with a solution but we are working on it uh we are working on it so when we find something that we think will benefit clients we will share it uh with our uh clients um the one on withdraw I think we've addressed it a big concern on liquidity by a househ sh you want to take that yeah so I would say that you know if you you have a concern around liquidity you shouldn't even be thinking about topping up your cpf or SRS right uh or even your SRS right so just to be clear when you top up your cpf there there's no way you're going to get them get the money back unless you're G to um you know you you receive it through the form of maybe a medical claim from Med safe or in the form of your cpf live payouts uh when you're at the age of 65 right so this is a very important long-term commitment right um but when it comes to SRS uh you know you can break the SRS account as Li sing and I share but of course you will be subjected to a 5% penalty as well as a $15,300 uh uh for for that 15,300 or whatever amount that you withraw and that full amount will also be liable added into your income tax right and and you can imagine if you suddenly have another $15,300 into your chargeable income then you might be paying much much much higher income tax rate uh for that right so I I would say do not go into cpf and SRS uh top UPS uh for the just for the sake of tax relief uh with the expectation that you know there's a you know a 20 30% chance that you would uh be breaking it because it's it's really not worth it right so uh for the worst feel free to go and top up a smaller amount if you need to reserve some money for more short-term needs yep so that's it I think there was a question I think the top question is what are the differences between topping up cpf and SRS and which one is more beneficial right I think I can just go back to the previous slide and really just highlight that you know it's uh very much a personal decision right and you know how you view uh what what age you are at how you invest what's your uh what's your view of the markets all of these are actually factors in into your decision and there is also another question maybe just jumping around a bit um you know should I top about my cpfs or should I talk about my cpf ma right what's uh I heard cpf ma is more flexible so does that mean that it's better um again it's up to personal preferences uh I I would agree that cpf Ma is more flexible because you can immediately use it for your medical bills right and uh that since the interest are all the same at 4.04% or 4% right you it doesn't really matter whether you talk about Ma and sa so some people really prefer pop up popping up into ma because they can get the uh get some use out of it um the way I would look at it of trying to think of scenarios that there might be people preferring cpfs a topups is that you know you for people who really want to invest their cpfs say then they would feel that hey if I were to top up the $8,000 then you know the remaining parts of my cpf sa I could actually invest them right because that would free up another $8,000 for me to invest my cpfa right but typically that there are not many of such people right and and for people who are considering cpf topups um I I think the Assumption here is that everyone will hit F FRS right um so another scenario where someone would prefer cpf as they talk about is that they don't feel that uh you know they would definitely hit cpfs right so they want to definitely hit cpfs and therefore they want to allocate a sum of money there yeah so that is CP uh specifically around topping UPS the consideration between the top up options yeah let me see whether there's any questions around there again I think we are good on that front yeah maybe let's move down the list yeah so I think there was a question posted six days ago so hopefully the viewer is here today thank you for your question uh and congratulations on being uh a citizen um so the question is I'm s PR and and and in May became citizen uh it may become citizen in the future how does withdrawal affect me from SRS uh and when should I start redrawing there's no um there's no difference right the only difference is if you're not a PR uh and you're are Foreigner right so that addresses the question uh the next question SRS can be with drawn any point or time your penalty versus yeah I think that's a comment and that that's that's absolutely right that's correct um whoever posted it thank you for that how do I check my retirement age from my SRS as in I can't remember when I opened my SRS account uh if I'm not wrong um as long as you open your SRS account before the 1st of July 2022 I think it's Google bow right I think you guys can look at Google your retirement age should be age 62 um I think anything beyond that uh Beyond 1 July 222 uh it will be retirement age 6 I think Str is going to Google it to double check I'll will go down the questions uh if you need to withdraw withdraw if you need okay you're asking about whether you can uh you have to divest everything before 10 years is it I know I'm coming to that question yes you want to go for it um okay yeah so um just to be clear uh when you so this is the question you you need to withdraw everything within 10 years and what happens if you don't choose to withdraw right so based on what um the website the IRS website says is that you know even uh at the end of the 10 years they will treat whatever that's remaining in your SRS account including your cash including the value of your investment Holdings at that point of time they will treat it as a withdrawal right so so the value of it will be added into your income tax statement so that's how it works so you don't I think to to answer the question uh specifically you don't have to divest right as I Shi mentioned earlier if you have existing Securities um basically it just trans you are be you'll be able to apply to transfer it from your SRS account into uh your brokerage or your bank and so on and so forth details you have to go to your respective product provider for that um yeah so uh there's other questions on YouTube okay so there there's one specifically that say again very similar question if your SRS funds in endows are not fully withdrawn at the 10e Mark are they automatically redeem are they will this be fully taxable it's it will not be automatically redeemed but as I was sharing just now the value of the investment at point of time will be accounted for uh and then it will be added into your taxable income for that year okay um yeah another questions around that is I think we have answered this in various um variation right so if I withraw some amount from SRS after retirement can I top up my SRS answer is no you can't right so there was a slide that specifically highlights the scenario that you know at the point of fulfilling the retirement age require um statutory retirement age requirement if you were to withdraw already then you will not no longer be able to top up your SRS account I think there are a couple of investment related questions just bearing in mind uh we've got a minute left um so there's a question on I'm single prod I to know which investment he need SRS to get decent return from my retirement and along the way I got taxt releas so I think there are a lot I think shingi covered the the whole gamut of solutions available um so it really depends on your risk appetite uh your desired you know U returns and and your goals and so on and so forth so we won't be able to uh specifically address it here um uh yeah but you can check our website uh we have a lot of insect articles hopefully it gives you an idea of how best uh to use endows for that um there's also a question on cash Mark interest rates at 4% is it better to hold SRS funds in cash and then buy portfolios when S&P has a dip first and foremost we we don't know when S&P 500 is going to dip right if you looked at the market yesterday the S&P 500 is up another 1% hovering strong above 4,000 points uh not to say that it will continue to hold but at endows we hold the philosophy is we don't know where the market is going uh so it will really depend on on your status strategy it will really depend on uh how comfortable you are uh with investing now or you prefer to invest it later is it really a personal uh choice we won't be able to tell you um whether it's better to hold 4% now get 4% interest now and then invest data uh we won't be able to tell you uh that uh if we are honest with ourselves um I think we've answered a lot of the questions um there's one more uh what investment options on endows are best for SRS and what's the best for cpf right uh um if you were to look at our interface uh you will see that we will NCH our clients to consider our Flagship portfolio right uh for for both cpf and SRS right so the flagship portfolios are um constructed by our investment office right and um they basically gives you very low cost Diversified access to the global markets um and some of these funds are actually uh exclusive to endows uh within the cpf system and Sr system right as I was sharing just now now um you know we care a lot about access of investment products back to our clients uh as as a form of value to our clients and we work with Farm managers to make sure that some of these great low cost offerings are available so that they can get better outcomes long term right so the returns um on a shortterm basis you know you may not feel the impact of it but you know a 1% save savings on fees fund fees or platform fees would compound over a very long per uh compounded over a very long period of of time as with all this retirement savings or investment account will make a really really significant difference to your retirement right so so do consider those uh Flagship portfolios um if not we also have a lot of great uh funds available for cpf and SRS yep that's about it so sh maybe you could screen the QR code for uh the last chance for those of you who have not taken a screenshot and open your account um you know you know as a client from the client advisory team I one thing to note is you can just take a screenshot screen it open your account and then decide for yourself whether ands is the right platform uh for you um you can open the account without investing right so that's that's possible uh and you can start investing by just with a minimum of $1,000 right uh and then obviously if one is an accredited investor then obviously you have more uh Solutions available for you I think we have answered most of the question I think one the question is how do you check if you have an SRS account simply speaking just check if you have a local bank account just check the app you'll see it reflected there if you don't see it reflected there I would say very high chance you don't have an SRS account hopefully that answers your question uh Marcus um I don't think we will be sending the slight deck to the participants uh but the YouTube is available uh online so you can refer uh and and and if if you can't sleep you can always watch watch shingi and myself talking about SRS and cpf uh as well yeah so any last words Shi uh no uh thank you so much for joining us today and uh I mean I love the energy and the great questions asked by the the audience um one more Point uh there's a question specifically around like withdrawing SRS at a later age um in this case the age of 70 right yeah you can feel free to withdraw any later as and when you like uh that's uh I guess you know many many people are active and working Way Beyond 6 nowadays or or 63 right so so feel free to withraw later and then uh yeah the 10 year s the 10 year cycle will start as and when you first withraw but other than that all good good well
